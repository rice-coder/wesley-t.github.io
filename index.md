### Visualization Project
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rice-coder/projects/main/visualization-project-1/visualization-project-Wesley_Teo.png)

In this project, my main objective was to incorporate real-time diagnostics of a car seat manufacturing plant's operational processes to better manage available production lines and increase profit margin. Using data and analytics to track the production process of various machines in real time, I provided better visibility of the seat manufacturing process. An analytics dashboard was created using PowerBI to track the plant's operational process across various metrics i.e., downtime minutes, total machine utilization time, etc. Power Query Editor was used to cleaned the preliminary dataset and DAX expressions in PowerBI were used to create the visualized metrics.

Tested hypothesis of whether the implementation of a revised gate system in a mobile game helped to reduce churn and increase retention rate of gamers, thus increasing year-on-year revenue from game purchases. Conducted A-B testing, statistical sampling and analysis to come to conclusions.

Built a classification model to predict churn customers one month in advance and also identified key churn drivers for a telecom company. Completed end-to-end coding which included data cleaning, exploratory data analysis and feature engineering. Constructed a random forest classification model and tuned probability thresholds to better capture churn in this use case.

### Human Centered Design Projects

<b> Digital Essentials Project - Kopitiam </b>

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rice-coder/projects/main/hcd-projects/digital-essentials-kopitiam/degp-kopitiam.png)

Kopitiam food court (Kopitiam) has been hard hit by the pandemic due to 
government restrictions and the drive towards contactless interactions. The 
expectation is that these habits will be the new normal and the way of life 
going forward. <br><br>
In this project our team proposed:<br>
1. A redesign of the physical layout to streamline diners traffic<br>
2. Launch of an App to provide contactless ordering and payment<br>

The global online travel booking market is expected to grow by around USD 204 billion by 2024 with a CAGR of close to 5% despite the 
recent pandemic. Pelago is a young venture of Singapore Airlines group that is looking into tapping this market by connecting travelers 
with their unique experience offerings. It is looking for ways to address gaps in customer experience so as to improve customer satisfaction and retain their loyalty to use 
Pelago as their preferred booking platform to book their vacation. <br><br>

Our team proposed the use of an app that could:<br>
1. Provides seamless end-to-end experience for Millennials as the primary target user.<br> 
2. Encourages customer engagement by empowering them to build a community to share travel experiences and ideas.<br>
